# StarChaser

Starchaser is a simple but addicting Apple Watch game developed for the new **Watch OS 6 SDK** to run as an independent app. Its built entirely using Xcode and Swift, and is currently still in beta. I plan to release it to the app store when its ready. Through this game I've learned a lot about game design and the little things that make a game engaging and fun.

built with:

- Xcode/Swift
- Currently in beta on **Apple's TestFlight**

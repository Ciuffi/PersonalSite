# Ciuffi.dev

This is my personal website (The website you're on right now!). It's built using Nuxt, a Vue js framework, compiled as a Single Page Application. All the project posts and blog posts are rendered from markdown files automatically on build time using a semi-custom solution. I'll probably write more about this later.

## Tech stack

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) (Vue framework)
- [frontmatter-markdown-loader](https://github.com/hmsk/frontmatter-markdown-loader#readme) to load the markdown
- [Buefy](https://buefy.org/) css framework

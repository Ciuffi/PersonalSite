# Plug adblocker

I built an IOS ad blocker using **Xcode** and **Apple's Content Blocking library.** This is the first IOS app I've ever developed, and I learned a lot through the process of taking what was just an idea and turning it into a fully fledged product.

Bult with:

- Xcode/Swift
- Figma (for design work)
- Released on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/plug-adblocker/id1471830568?ls=1)

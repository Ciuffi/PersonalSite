acaMEDia is a vue.js-based webapp geared towards undergraduate and graduate Science students looking to gain more knowledge about current medical research papers and the flourishing scientific laboratories conducting the research.  This app was built at XDHacks, a 24 hour hackathon, and it taught me a lot about Vue and web development in general.

Built with:

- **VueJs** frontend
- **Node JS** backend connected to an **SQL database**
- **Node JS** web scraper for information gathering.
- Hosted on [Google Appspot](https://t-solstice-224300.appspot.com/#/)

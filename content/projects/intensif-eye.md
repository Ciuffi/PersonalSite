# Intensif-Eye

At Dubhacks 2019, a hackathon in seattle, My team and I created a magnification app to help people with low vision. It used **Machine Learning** to enhance pictures taken with the camera and read out text using **Google's Optical Character Recognition**

Built with:

- Expo/React-Native
- Google ML Vision and OCR
- Google Firebase functions
- Google Firestore
